## DataScience-AdultIncomeAnalysis
This project uses advanced statistical concepts, visualizations, Machine learning models to predict Adult Income category, which dataset is from Kaggle. However, upon performing EDA, effects of latent variables are found to be distorting the dataset and its results. The dataset is likely suffering from omitted variable bias and endogeneity. A small portion of the dataset which likely will not be affected by these omitted variables was picked out for modeling, and the predictive results were much better in comparison. This is indicative of the fact that the missing information is affecting the dataset. In the absence of corrective data, models were created for the existing dataset, and reccomendations/observations were gathered accordingly.
